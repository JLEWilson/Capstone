##### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I will keep a log of my unity components to the best of my ability. Many unity objects will require many Unity specific components such as Colliders, RigidBody, Camera, SpriteRenderer, Animators etc, some of which will placed on an object of my creation within the editor while some will be added to components via code. Any Additional functionality needed (such as camera follow, player controller etc.) I will be creating from scratch and will add to a unity components tree. I may make different trees for different objects.
