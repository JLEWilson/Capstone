##### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I will keep a log of my unity components to the best of my ability. Many unity objects will require Unity Objects such as Collidors, RigidBody, Camera, Lighting etc, some of which will placed on an object of my creation without any change needed. Any Additional functionality needed (such as camera follow, player controller etc.) I will be creating and will add to a unity components tree. I may make different trees for different objects.
